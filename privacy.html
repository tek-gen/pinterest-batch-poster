  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the <strong>Pinterest Batch Poster</strong> desktop application handles your data. By using this software, you agree to the practices described here.</p>

  <h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>
  <p>This application does <strong>not collect, store, or transmit</strong> any personal data from users. All operations are performed locally on your device.</p>

  <h2>2. Pinterest API Usage</h2>

  <p>Your token is stored <strong>locally</strong> on your machine and is <strong>never shared</strong> externally.</p>

  <h2>3. NVIDIA or AI API Integration</h2>
  <p>If you choose to use AI-generated descriptions or tags, your selected image is sent to the corresponding AI API (e.g., NVIDIA Picasso or OpenAI) for analysis. These services are external and subject to their own privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>4. No Analytics, No Ads</h2>
  <p>This application does not use cookies, analytics tools, or advertising frameworks of any kind.</p>
